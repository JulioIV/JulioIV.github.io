<h2> <strong> What you should know:</strong> </h2>
Born: December 11, 1989 - Bronx, New York 
<br>
I am an artist raised in the slums of New York and currently living in South Florida.  I call
<br>
myself an artist because claiming what your specialty is categorizes your skill set at 
	<br>
	everything else. My skills include graphic design, web design, written work such as:
	<br> poetry, short stories, song writing, & etc. & I love to dabble with canvas
	<br> & camera art as well. If there is anything I ever leanered from stereotypes, 
	<br> it's that they will always be there but its up to you to break them thus, I 
	<br> am an artist. Nothing less.
<p>
	I was born in the South Bronx to an immigrant Dominican father and a Cuban-Japanese mother.
	<br> My mother loved to travel whereever she worked and me being a huge "Momma's boy", 
	<br> my bags were always packed. From New York, to Chicago, to South Beach, I learned
	<br> as much as could whereever we lived increasing my contact list, knowledge, & 
	<br> of course my passion for the arts. 
	<p> 
		I enlisted in the United States military straight out of highschool and 8years
		<br> years later, I am still a proud enlisted member of The Florida Army 
		<br> National Gaurd.  I am currently studying web design at the 
		<br>
		Miami International University of Art & Design. Let's spread art!
